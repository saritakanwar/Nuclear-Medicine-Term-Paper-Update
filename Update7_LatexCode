\section*{Abstract}
With the development of radio-therapeutic oncology, computer technology and medical imaging technology, radiation therapy has made great progress\cite{wang2018biological}. Radiation's benefits were initially realised in the use of X-rays for medical diagnosis, and then later with the discovery of radiation and radioactivity. The desire to take advantage of the medical benefits led to a reasonable assessment of the hazards and resulting consequences. Only the most evident effects of large doses of radiation, such as radiation burns, were noticed in those early days, and protection efforts were concentrated on preventing them, mostly for practitioners rather than patients\cite{flakus1982detecting}.
In this term paper we will be discussing about the various sources of radiation, medical applications of radiation and how the damage produced by ionizing radiation in biological molecules affects the body cells.

\section*{Introduction}
Modern techniques in nuclear medicine have proven to be powerful tools for diagnosis and treatment of an increasing number of diseases\cite{signore2010molecular}. However, they all add to the patient's radiation exposure. As a result, constant attention should be paid to reducing the radiation dose involved. The risks associated with a specific nuclear procedure should be known in order to weigh its advantage against its disadvantages\cite{cerqueira2010recommendations}. These risks depend on the dose and dose and dose-effect relationship. The discipline involved in dose calculation is called dosimetry. The combination of the results of dosimetry and dose-effect relation allows the estimation of the risk associated with a certain nuclear procedure\cite{de1993biological}.
\par People would appreciate that radiation has quiet and useful applications in our daily lives once they understand it. New difficulties in terms of worldwide levels of radiation exposure continue to emerge, new biological information on the impacts of radiation exposure is becoming available\cite{zakariya2014benefits}.

\section*{Sources of Radiation}
As a part of living on earth, people are exposed to radiation from various sources every day. Radiation is the energy that travels through
space, in the form of particles or electromagnetic waves such as radio, microwaves, infra-red, visible light, ultraviolet, alpha particles, X-rays and Gamma-rays etc\cite{zakariya2014benefits}. According to \cite{sherer2013radiation} these sources of ionizing
radiation could be from natural background radiation such as radon and thoron, cosmic and terrestrial radiation, or man-made radiation such as those from xray or nuclear medicine (NM) procedures.
\subsection*{Natural Radiation}
The assessment of the natural radiation doses from natural sources in human is of particular importance  natural radiation is the largest contributor to the collective dose of world population\cite{united2000exposures}. The natural radiation sources are classified into:
\begin{itemize}
    \item External Irradiation
    \item Internal Irradiation
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{External Irradiation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Cosmic Radiation:}\par This is simply the radiation from the sun and stars. Flying based at high altitudes much frequently and for long duration will attract extra cosmic radiation exposure\cite{hapgood2011towards}.
    \item \textbf{Terrestrial Radiation:}\par This is the radiation due to the presence of radioactive materials such as uranium, thorium, and radium that exist naturally in soil, water and rocks. Essentially air contains radon, which is responsible for the dose from natural background sources, and all organic matter (plant and animal) also contains radioactive carbon and potassium\cite{kovler2017basic}. However, the dose from these sources varies in different parts of the world, but locations with higher soil concentrations of uranium and thorium generally have higher doses. Therefore, the background radiation levels vary in certain areas due to geological differences and sometimes the exposure can be more than 200 times higher than the global average\cite{tzortzis2003gamma}.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Internal Irradiation}
From birth to death, this sort of radiation is caused by the internal composition of human bodies, which includes radioactive potassium-40 and carbon-14\cite{ford2004radiation}.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Artificial (Man-made) Radiation:}\par The following are examples of man-made radiation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Medical techniques such as diagnostic x-rays, nuclear medicine, and radiation therapy expose people to radiation. Consumer products, such as building materials, combustible fuels (gas and coal), television, and cell phones, are also included in this category.
        \item Radiation from nuclear sites, which account for less than 0.01 percent of the average annual dose, as well as exposure from radioactive materials shipment and residual fallout from nuclear weapons testing and accidents like Chernobyl.
    \end{itemize}
 \end{enumerate}

 \section*{Biological Effects of Radiation}
 Biological Effects of Radiation can be broken into two groups according to how the responses (symptoms or effects) relate to dose (or amount of radiation received)
 \begin{enumerate}
     \item The First Group of biological effects are Stochastic Effects
     \item The Second Group of biological effects are Deterministic Effects
 \end{enumerate}
The first category consists of exposure to low doses of radiation over an extended period of time producing chronic or long term effects (Stochastic) while the second category represents exposure to high doses of radiation over short periods of time producing acute or short term effects (Deterministic). The high doses tend to kill cells, while low doses tend to damage or change them. High doses can kill so many cells that will lead to damage of tissues and organs. This may result to a rapid whole body response often called the Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS)\cite{zakariya2014benefits}. The effect of radiation is dependent on many factors including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The type of radiation (alpha, beta or gamma)
    \item The amount received
    \item The rate at which it is received
    \item Which part of the body is exposed
    \item Whether the exposure is chronic (regular, low doses) or acute (short time, high dose)
    \item The age of the irradiated person.
\end{itemize}
 
 \section*{Dosimetry} 
The science of "dosimetry" is the measurement, calculation, or combination of measurement and calculation used to calculate radiation exposure. Radiation dosage is also known as "absorbed dose," which is defined as the quantity of radiation energy deposited in tissue divided by the tissue's mass. The most important physical component that impacts the response of tumours and the rest of the body to radiation is the absorbed dosage\cite{kirby1992uncertainty}. When a subject is exposed to radiation, dosimetry provides a method of calculating parameter for risk estimation. Thereby two different situations have to be distinguished: irradiation from an external source and irradiation from activity present inside the body. These two situations require a different approach.
\newline\textbf{External Source}
\newline The following aspects are involved in these calculations:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the strength or activity of the radioactive source;
    \item the exposure of the subject to such radiation;
    \item the dose absorbed by the different tissues;
    \item the biological effectiveness of the type of radiation;
    \item the weighting of the seperate organs
\end{enumerate}
These items will all be discussed subsequently in this section. Since the introduction of the Systeme internationale (SI) as the basis for quantification of scientific measurements, the units for most radiation quantities have been changed. The relation between those SI units and their corresponding conventional is indicated in Table 1

\subsection*{Why it is important?}
Absorbed dose determines the extent to which tumors and normal tissues are affected by radiation.  The higher the absorbed dose to tumors, the more cells will be killed by radiation and the greater the likelihood of a cure.  However, the higher the absorbed dose to normal tissues, the more likely and severe may be the undesirable toxic side-effects of the radiation.  An important advantage of radiopharmaceutical therapy is its ability to irradiate and effectively treat tumors throughout the body; at the same time, some irradiation of normal organs is unavoidable.  Therefore, the role of radiation dosimetry in targeted radionuclide therapy is to determine specifically, for each patient, the administered amount of the radiopharmaceutical that will most effectively treat the patientâ€™s disease while avoiding absorbed doses that damage normal tissues.  Individualized radiation dosimetry is critical for planning the most effective and safest targeted radionuclide therapy for each patient.
